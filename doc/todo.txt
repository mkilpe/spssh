* check that packet is not too large before sending
* check that packet is not too large when receiving
* check re-kexing works (automated test)
* implement starting re-kexing after n-bytes
* change the ssh_state to have just transport state and separately keep track of service et al
* refactor common bits from ssh_client and ssh_server to a base class
* implement requests for channels/connection
* implement test client/server configuration from command line / settings file

* implement more kexes
* check only correct packets allowed while in kex and other states
* implement cryptographic random (for example nettle does not have one)
* investigate post-quantum crypto algorithms

not implemented yet:
* possible certificates associated to public key when authenticating
