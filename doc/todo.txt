* check that packet is not too large before sending
* check that packet is not too large when receiving
* check re-kexing works (automated test)
* implement starting re-kexing after n-bytes
* refactor common bits from ssh_client and ssh_server to a base class

* implement more kexes
* check only correct packets allowed while in kex and other states
* implement cryptographic random (for example nettle does not have one)
* investigate post-quantum crypto algorithms

not implemented yet:
* possible certificates associated to public key when authenticating
