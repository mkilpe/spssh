* check re-kexing works
* implement more kexes
* check only correct packets allowed while in kex and other states
* implement counter mode + hmac to make sure the packet encryption/decryption works
* investigate 2fa with ssh (RFC 4256)
* implement cryptographic random (for example nettle does not have one)
* investigate post-quantum crypto algorithms
