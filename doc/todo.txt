* implement interactive auth (RFC 4256)
* check re-kexing works (automated test)
* implement more kexes
* implement hostbased auth
* implement creating private keys and saving them
* check only correct packets allowed while in kex and other states
* implement counter mode + hmac to make sure the packet encryption/decryption works
* implement cryptographic random (for example nettle does not have one)
* investigate post-quantum crypto algorithms


not implemented yet:
* possible certificates associated to public key when authenticating
* delayed replay for authentication to stop certain attacks
