Cross compiling for windows using fedora
----------------------------------------

* install mingw cross compiling tools (dnf install mingw64-gcc-c++)
* install dependencies (dnf install mingw64-nettle)
* instead of 'cmake' use 'mingw64-cmake'
* make

Test on Wine:
* install wine
* set path for dlls: for example 'wine reg add HKCU\\Environment /f /v PATH /d "z:\usr\x86_64-w64-mingw32\sys-root\mingw\bin"'
  (can first try to run the test_spssh.exe on wine and see which dlls not found and use locate to find them)
* wine test_spssh.exe
