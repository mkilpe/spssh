 uint32    packet_length
 byte      padding_length
 byte[n1]  payload; n1 = packet_length - padding_length - 1
 byte[n2]  random padding; n2 = padding_length
 byte[m]   mac (Message Authentication Code - MAC); m = mac_length


Sending packet:

 1. compress payload
 2. calculate padding
 3. calculate packet length
 4. construct unencrypted packet
 5. calculate mac
 6. encrypt packet (not the mac)

 notice that steps 5-6 are combined in case of GCM and works bit differently


 Receiving packet:

 1. decrypt first max(8, cipher block size) bytes to get length
 2. decrypt rest of the packet with the known length
 3. verify mac
 4. check packet restrictions (padding size)
 5. decompress payload

 notice that steps 1-3 are combined in case of GCM and works bit differently
